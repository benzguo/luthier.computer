# flexjar

## Getting started

- Create an `.env.local` using the info from the Paper brainstorming doc
- `yarn` (install dependencies)
- `yarn dev` (run locally)
- Changes merged to master will automatically deploy to Vercel.
  - Vercel teams costs \$20/month, so we can just use the Github integration instead.
